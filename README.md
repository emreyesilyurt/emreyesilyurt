## **Hi ThereðŸ‘‹ I'm Emre YESILYURT**


I am a final-year Management Information Systems student. I have technical knowledge of building machine learning models to support decision-making. I am also interested in Linux system architecture. You can find some of the models I developed on my Github and Kaggle accounts. I also have a Medium account where I blog when I have time. Recently, I have been researching the industry applicability of unsupervised machine learning methods.
